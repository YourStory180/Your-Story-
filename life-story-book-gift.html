    <h1>Top 5 Life Story Book Gifts for Grandparents This Christmas</h1>
    <p>When it comes to Christmas gifts for grandparents, nothing compares to the power of a personal story. A life story book isn’t just a present—it’s a legacy. It captures memories, milestones, and the wisdom of a lifetime in a format that can be passed down for generations.</p>
