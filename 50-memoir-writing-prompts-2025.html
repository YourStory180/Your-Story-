        <!-- Article Content -->
        <article class="article-content">
            <p><strong>The blank page stares back at you.</strong> You know you have incredible stories to tell—decades of experiences, relationships, challenges, and triumphs that have shaped who you are. But where do you start? How do you dig beneath the surface of "what happened" to discover the stories that truly matter?</p>

            <p>The secret lies in asking the right questions. Not the obvious ones like "Where were you born?" or "What was your first job?"—but the deeper, more specific prompts that unlock the emotional core of your experiences.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Why these prompts work:</strong> Each question is designed to bypass your conscious mind's tendency to stick to "safe" memories and instead access the vivid, emotionally resonant moments that make compelling stories.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="serif">How to Use These Prompts Effectively</h2>

            <p>Before diving into the prompts, here are three strategies to maximize their impact:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Write without editing:</strong> Give yourself 15-20 minutes per prompt and write continuously. Don't worry about grammar, structure, or "making it good"—just capture the memories as they come.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on sensory details:</strong> What did you see, hear, smell, taste, or feel? Specific details bring stories to life and trigger additional memories.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for patterns:</strong> As you work through different prompts, notice recurring themes, relationships, or types of experiences that seem significant to your story.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="prompt-section">
                <h3 class="serif">🏠 Childhood & Family Origins</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><em>These prompts help you rediscover formative experiences and family dynamics that shaped your worldview.</em></p>
                <ol class="prompt-list">
                    <li>Describe a family dinner conversation that revealed something important about your family's values or conflicts.</li>
                    <li>What was the most rebellious thing you did as a child, and how did the adults in your life react?</li>
                    <li>Write about a time when you realized your parents were fallible human beings, not perfect authorities.</li>
                    <li>Describe the house, apartment, or place you lived longest as a child—focus on one specific room and what happened there.</li>
                    <li>What family story was told and retold? Why do you think it was so important to preserve?</li>
                    <li>Write about a moment when you felt completely misunderstood by your family.</li>
                    <li>Describe a tradition your family had that you either loved or dreaded. What made it significant?</li>

                    <li>Describe the moment when you first felt like a "real" adult—not just older, but fundamentally different.</li>

            <h2 class="serif">Making Your Memories Into Stories</h2>

            <p>Once you've worked through these prompts, you'll likely have dozens of memory fragments, scenes, and insights. The next step is recognizing which ones have the potential to become compelling stories.</p>

            <p><strong>Look for memories that include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific dialogue or conversations you can still hear</li>
                <li>Strong sensory details—what you could see, hear, smell, or feel</li>
                <li>Moments of internal conflict or difficult decisions</li>
                <li>Times when your understanding of yourself or the world shifted</li>
                <li>Experiences that connect to larger themes in your life</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The "So What?" Test</h3>
            <p>For each memory you've captured, ask yourself: "So what? Why does this matter?" The most powerful life stories aren't just about what happened—they're about what it meant, how it changed you, and what wisdom it offers to others.</p>
